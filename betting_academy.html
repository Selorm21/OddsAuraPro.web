        requirement, do not stake 100% of what you staked previosly, Stake 50%
        or 70% of your previous winnings. <br />
        For example, if you won $100 with a $50 stake, stake $50/$70 the next
        day.Always leave something behind incase you lose. <br />Investors who
        ar willing to take high risk can use the multiplier method, where they
        stake all their winnings for any number of consecutive times they want.

        instance, bets on certain markets or odds may not count fully towards
        the rollover. Always check the terms and conditions of the bonus to
        understand how different bets contribute.
